## Write a short comment describing this function

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}
# The makeCacheMatrix function is designed to create a special type of
# matrix that can store or cache its inverse. This way, if the inverse is needed 
# multiple times, the function can quickly retrieve the stored value instead of recalculating 
# it every time, saving time and resources. This is typically used in conjunction with
# the cacheSolve function for storing the inverse of a matrix.



## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
# The cacheSolve function is used to get the inverse of the matrix created by
# makeCacheMatrix.It first checks if the inverse has already been calculated
# and stored (cached).If it has, the cached value is returned, saving time. If not,
# the function will calculate the inverse, store it in the cache,
# and then return it.
